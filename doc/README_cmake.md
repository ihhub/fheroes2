Building with CMake
--------------------------------
### Linux and macOS

fheroes2 can be built with CMake buildsystem. First, you need to install dependencies. For Linux and macOS follow to instructions as described above.

Next, you can build project with following commands:

```shell
# SDL1
cmake -B build -DUSE_SDL_VERSION=SDL -DENABLE_IMAGE=ON -DENABLE_MIXER=ON -DENABLE_UNICODE=ON
# OR
# SDL2
cmake -B build -DUSE_SDL_VERSION=SDL2 -DENABLE_IMAGE=ON -DENABLE_MIXER=ON -DENABLE_UNICODE=ON
```

After configuration let's build project:

```shell
cmake --build build
```

After building, executable can be found in build/src/fheroes2/ directory.

### Windows / Visual Studio

For Windows you'll need Visual Studio 2019 with C++ support and [vcpkg package manager](https://vcpkg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for dependency management.
Here quick and short instruction for deployment:

```shell
# Clone vcpkg repository. For convenient, let's place it in C:\vcpkg directory, but it can be anywhere.
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg.git
# Now initialize manager
.\vcpkg\bootstrap-vcpkg.bat
```

Your vcpkg is ready to install external libraries. Assuming that you use x64 system, let's install all needed dependencies:

```shell
.\vcpkg\vcpkg --triplet x64-windows install libiconv sdl2 sdl2-image sdl2-mixer sdl2-ttf zlib
```

If you planning to develop fheroes2 with Visual Studio, you may want to integrate vcpkg with it (requires elevated admin privileges).
After following command Visual Studio automagically will find all required dependencies:

```shell
.\vcpkg\vcpkg integrate install
```

Now you ready to compile project. cd to fheroes2 directory and run `cmake` command (note for `-DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE` and `-DVCPKG_TARGET_TRIPLET` options):

```shell
# SDL2
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE="C:\vcpkg\scripts\buildsystems\vcpkg.cmake" -DVCPKG_TARGET_TRIPLET=x64-windows -DUSE_SDL_VERSION=SDL2 -DENABLE_IMAGE=ON -DENABLE_MIXER=ON -DENABLE_UNICODE=ON 
```

After configuration let's build project:

```shell
cmake --build build --config Release
```

After building, executable can be found in build\src\fheroes2\Release directory.
