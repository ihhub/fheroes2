# fheroes2

**Free Heroes of Might and Magic II** (fheroes2) is a recreation of HoMM2 game engine.

This open source multiplatform project, written from scratch, is designed to reproduce the original game with significant
improvements in the gameplay, graphics and logic (including support for high-resolution graphics, improved AI, numerous fixes
and UI improvements), breathing new life into one of the most addictive turn-based strategies.
