# fheroes2

**fheroes2** is a recreation of the Heroes of Might and Magic II game engine.

This open source multiplatform project, written from scratch, is designed to reproduce the original game with significant
improvements in gameplay, graphics and logic (including support for high-resolution graphics, improved AI, numerous fixes
and user interface improvements), breathing new life into one of the most addictive turn-based strategy games.

You can find a complete list of all of our changes and enhancements in [**its own wiki page**](https://github.com/ihhub/fheroes2/wiki/Features-and-enhancements-of-the-project).
