# [**fheroes2**](README.md) build and contribution guide

## Build

Please follow the instructions below to be able to build the project from source:

<a name="windows"></a>
### Windows

* Go to the directory `script/windows` and run the file `install_packages.bat`. This script will install all the
  required packages to build the project using Microsoft Visual Studio.
* If you have the original game, then copy the subdirectories `ANIM`, `DATA`, `MAPS` and `MUSIC` (some of them may
  be missing depending on the version of the original game) to the project root directory.
* Alternatively, go to the directory `script/demo` and run the file `download_demo_version.bat`.
  This script will download a demo version of the original game, which is the minimum required for development.
* Open the file `fheroes2-vs2019.vcxproj` (targeted for Visual Studio 2019) and build the project.
* Visual Studio will automatically copy game files in the root directory to the build directory.

<a name="macos-and-linux"></a>
### macOS and Linux

* Depending on your OS, run the following scripts to install the dependencies required for the build:
  * macOS: go to the directory `script/macos` and run the file `install_sdl_2.sh` (default setup) or `install_sdl_1.sh`.
  * Linux: go to the directory `script/linux` and run the file `install_sdl_2_dev.sh` (default setup) or `install_sdl_1_dev.sh`.
* If you have the original game, then copy the subdirectories `ANIM`, `DATA`, `MAPS` and `MUSIC` (some of them may
  be missing depending on the version of the original game) to the project root directory.
* Alternatively, go to the directory `script/demo` and run the file `download_demo_version.sh`.
  This script will download a demo version of the original game, which is the minimum required for development.
* Run the `make` command in the root directory of the project to build it with **SDL2** or `make FHEROES2_WITH_SDL1="ON"`
