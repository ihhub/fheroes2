All rights for the original game and its resources belong to former The 3DO Company.
These rights were transferred to Ubisoft. We do not encourage and do not support
any form of illegal usage of the original game. We strongly advise to purchase
the original game on GOG or Ubisoft Store platforms.

Alternatively, you can download a free demo version of the game (in English only)
using one of the bundled scripts.

--- Installation and Requirements ---
You will need to have a demo version or the full version of Heroes of Might and
Magic II game to be able to play.

If you do not have the original Heroes of Might and Magic II game, run the
'download_demo_version.bat' file for Windows or 'download_demo_version.sh' for Linux
OS and macOS. This script will download and install all the necessary files from the
demo version of the original Heroes of Might and Magic II game.

If you have a legally purchased copy of the original game, run the
'extract_homm2_resources.bat' file for Windows or 'extract_homm2_resources.sh' for Linux
OS and macOS. This script will extract all the necessary resource files.

As an alternative to the previous step, you can manually copy the subdirectories 'ANIM',
'DATA', 'MAPS' and 'MUSIC' (some of them may be missing depending on the version of the
original game) from the original game directory to the fheroes2 installation directory.

If you are running fheroes2 on Windows and see complaints about missing DLLs, then you
may need to install the Microsoft Visual C++ redistributable package. You can download
it using the following URLs:

https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x86.exe - for 32-bit x86 fheroes2 builds;
https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe - for 64-bit x64 fheroes2 builds.

Or you can install the game using the installer, in this case, this package will be
installed automatically.
