Download
---------------------------
You can download compiled game for specific OS via [**Github releases**](https://github.com/ihhub/fheroes2/releases) of this project.

Please note that for **Windows OS** you have to install [**Visual Studio 2015 Redistributable**](https://www.microsoft.com/en-sg/download/details.aspx?id=48145) if you face an error during application startup.

Compilation
---------------------------
Please follow below instructions to be able to compile the project:

**Windows**
- **Optional step**: Install **7-zip** archiver at your local system's folder as- `C:\Program Files\7-Zip\7z.exe` or otherwise, you will need to manually extract each downloaded package (follow instructions shown by batch scripts mentioned below).
- open `script/windows` directory and run **install_packages.bat** file. It installs necessary packages for Visual Studio build.
- open `script/demo` directory and run **demo_windows.bat** file. It downloads a demo version of the game which is needed for minimum development.
- open **fheroes.vcxproj** by Visual Studio and compile the project.

**MacOS and Linux**
- open `script/macos` or `script/linux` directory depending on your OS and run **install_sdl_1.sh** or **install_sdl_2.sh** file. For MacOS we recommend to run SDL 2 as latest versions of MacOS do not support SDL 1 fully.
- open `script/demo` directory and run **demo_macos.sh** or **demo_linux.sh** file depending on your OS. It downloads a demo version of the game which is needed for minimum development.
- run `make` command in root directory of the project. For SDL 2 compilation please run `export WITH_SDL2="ON"` command before compiling the project.
