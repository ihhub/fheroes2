Download
---------------------------
You can download a compiled version of the game for your operating system at [**Github releases**](https://github.com/ihhub/fheroes2/releases) of this project.

Copyright
---------------------------
All rights for the original game and its resources belong to former The 3DO Company. These rights were transferred to Ubisoft. We do not encourage and do not support any form of illegal usage of the original game. We strongly advise to purchase the original game on [**GOG**](https://www.gog.com) or [**Ubisoft Store**](https://store.ubi.com) platforms. Alternatively, you can download a free demo version of the game.

Requirements
---------------------------
You are required to have at least a demo version of Heroes of Might and Magic 2 game to be able to play it. Please use one of our scripts to download the demo version of the original game. A script comes with the compiled game.

MacOS and Linux
--------------------------
Unix OSes need an explicit installation of SDL packages. Please go to `script/macos` or `script/linux` directory depending on your OS package and run **install_sdl_1.sh** or **install_sdl_2.sh** file. For Arch based Linux distributions use the command `sudo pacman -S sdl sdl_mixer` instead. RPM based distributions like Fedora/Red Hat use the commands `sudo yum/dnf install SDL*`. openSUSE supports the One-Click-Install via `SDL_mixer.ymp` file in `script/linux`. For MacOS we highly recommend to use SDL 2 as latest versions of MacOS do not fully support SDL 1.

Please follow below instructions to be able to compile the project:

Windows
------------------------
- **Optional step**: Install **7-zip** archiver at its default location as `C:\Program Files\7-Zip\7z.exe` or otherwise, you will need to manually extract each downloaded package (follow the instructions shown by batch scripts mentioned below).
- open `script/windows` directory and run **install_packages.bat** file. It installs necessary packages for Visual Studio build.
- open `script/demo` directory and run **demo_windows.bat** file. It downloads a demo version of the game which is needed for minimum development.
- open **fheroes2-vs2015.vcxproj** or **fheroes2-vs2019.vcxproj** file depending on your Visual Studio and compile the project.

MacOS and Linux
-------------------
- open `script/macos` or `script/linux` directory depending on your OS and run **install_sdl_2.sh** (default setup) or **install_sdl_1.sh** file. For MacOS we do not recommend to run SDL 1 as latest versions of MacOS do not support it fully.
- open `script/demo` directory and run **demo_macos.sh** or **demo_linux.sh** file depending on your OS. It downloads a demo version of the game which is needed for minimum development.
- run `make` command in root directory of the project. For SDL 1 compilation please run `export FHEROES2_SDL1="ON"` command before compiling the project.
