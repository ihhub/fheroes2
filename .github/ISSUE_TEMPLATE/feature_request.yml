      ## Please note

      The current project improvement policy is mainly focused on making
      the gameplay more user-friendly and easier to interact with, while
      keeping the spirit of the original game intact. Make sure the feature
      you are about to request will be the most useful for the majority of
      users. We do not accept feature requests related to the overall game
      balance (such as creating new monsters or castles) or various
      "improvements" to the appearance of existing game monsters or objects.
