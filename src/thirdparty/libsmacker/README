Introduction
---
libsmacker is a cross-platform C library which can be used for decoding Smacker Video files produced by RAD Game Tools. Smacker Video was the king of video middleware in the 1990s, and its 256-color compressed video format was used in over 2600 software titles.

libsmacker implements the minimum feature set required from smackw32.dll to get an smk off a disk and the frames / audio into a buffer in the correct order.

Usage
---
See the webpage for sample code and function documentation.  The source package additionally includes a pair of driver programs:
* driver.c - dumps all frames of a file to a bmp/ subdirectory, and all audio as raw streams to out_*.raw files in CWD
* smk2avi.c - converts smk file(s) to AVI files - uncompressed 24-bit color and PCM audio stream.

Though the libraries are "bulletproofed" the sample apps are not: be cautious if you plan to implement in some critical environment.
