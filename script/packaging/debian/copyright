 Statement of Purpose
 .
 The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
 exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator
 and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work
 of authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").
 .
 Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work
 for the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and
 scientific works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without
 fear of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in
 other works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form
 whatsoever and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial
 purposes. These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal
 of a free culture and the further production of creative, cultural and
 scientific works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for
 their Work in part through the use and efforts of others.
 .
 For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any
 expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person
 associating CC0 with a Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that
 he or she is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work,
 voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute
 the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and
 Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal effect
 of CC0 on those rights.
 .
 1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be
 protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright
 and Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are
 not limited to, the following:
 .
    i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display,
       communicate, and translate a Work;
   ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
  iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or
       likeness depicted in a Work;
   iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,
       subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;
    v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse
       of data in a Work;
   vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC
       of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996
       on the legal protection of databases, and under any national
       implementation thereof, including any amended or successor version
       of such directive); and
  vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout
       the world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national
       implementations thereof.
 .
 2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention
 of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently,
 irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all
 of Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and
 causes of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing
 as well as future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in
 all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by
 applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii)
 in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv)
 for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial,
 advertising or promotional purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes the
 Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to the
 detriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that such
 Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation,
 termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the
 quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer's
 express Statement of Purpose.
 .
 3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any
 reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law,
 then the Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted
 taking into account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In
 addition, to the extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby
 grants to each affected person a royalty-free, non transferable, non
 sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and unconditional license
 to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work (i)
 in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided
 by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii)
 in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv)
 for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial,
 advertising or promotional purposes (the "License"). The License shall
 be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the
 Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally
 invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity
 or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License,
 and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i)
 exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in
 the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of action
 with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's express
 Statement of Purpose.
 .
 4. Limitations and Disclaimers.
 .
    a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived,
       abandoned, surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this
       document.
    b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or
       warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied,
       statutory or otherwise, including without limitation warranties
       of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non
       infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy,
       or the present or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable,
       all to the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.
    c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other
       persons that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including
       without limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the
       Work. Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any
       necessary consents, permissions or other rights required for any
       use of the Work.
    d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not
       a party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect
       to this CC0 or use of the Work.

License: GeneralUser-2.0
  ** License of the complete work **
 You may use GeneralUser GS without restriction for your own music creation,
 private or commercial. This SoundFont bank is provided to the community
 free of charge. Please feel free to use it in your software projects,
 and to modify the SoundFont bank or its packaging to suit your needs.
 .
  ** License of contained samples **
 GeneralUser GS inherits the usage rights of the samples contained within,
 all of which allow full use in music production, including the ability
 to make profit from musical recordings created with GeneralUser GS.
 .
 Many of the samples are original, but some were taken from other banks
 freely (and legally) available on the Internet from various SoundFont
 websites. Because GeneralUser GS originated as a personal project with
 no intention for publication, I cannot be 100% sure where all of the
 samples originated, although I do know that none of them came from
 commercially published SoundFont packages or sample CDs. Regardless,
 many "free" SoundFonts available on the web may indeed contain samples
 of questionable origin. My understanding of the copyrights of all samples
 is only as good as the information provided by the original sources.
 If you become aware of any restricted samples being used in GeneralUser GS,
 please let me know so I can replace them.
 .
 This uncertainty may concern you if you intend to use GeneralUser GS in
 a commercial software product. That being said, I have never received any
 complaint regarding sample ownership since I published the original GeneralUser GS
 back in 2000, and as far as I am aware, neither have any of the companies creating
 commercial software products using GeneralUser GS.
